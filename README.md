# Power-BI-Dashboard-Submarine-Incidents-Analysis-2000-2023
This project shows Submarine Incidents Analysis (2000-2023)

INTRODUCTION

In light of the recent unfortunate Titen submersible incident, I decided to explore submarine incidents spanning the past 23 years. I have created a Power BI dashboard that provides valuable insights into these incidents, enabling us to gain a deeper understanding of their occurrence, the countries most affected, and the associated human toll. By delving into this data, we can shed light on crucial aspects of submarine safety. Join me as we navigate through this insightful dashboard and strive for a safer and more secure maritime environment.

DATA COLLECTION

I collected this data from Wikipedia and then extracted the data into an Excel file. I also took some help from chat GPT.
